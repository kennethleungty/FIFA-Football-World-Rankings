# Combining the Best of Both Python and R for FIFA Football Ranking Analysis

The "language war" between Python and R has been a longstanding contentious topic in the data science field that is still widely discussed today.  

In reality, the best language is the one that best fits the specific job. After all, Python and R are just tools for data practitioners to perform the most crucial task - solve business problems with data.  

In this FIFA football world ranking analysis, we explore Python and R's different and common strengths (with implementation codes) and how they complement each other in a modern data science toolkit.
